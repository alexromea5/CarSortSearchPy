# Car Management & Sorting System

This is a Python-based project for managing, searching, and sorting a list of cars based on different criteria. The project was developed as part of an academic assignment, implementing sorting and searching algorithms for vehicle data.

## Features 
- **Sorting algorithms**: Implements both O(nÂ²) and O(n log n) sorting techniques.
- **Search algorithms**: Supports both sequential search and binary search.
- **Car entity management**: Each car has attributes like brand, model, token, purchase price, and sale price.
- **Command-based interface**: Users can interact with the program using commands.
- **Easter Egg ðŸ˜º**: A hidden `easteregg.py` script for extra functionality.
